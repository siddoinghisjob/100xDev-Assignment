Problem Statement : Find number of good pairs

You are given two strings, string 'a' and string 'b'. Your task is to find the number of good pairs between these strings.
A good pair is defined as {S1, S2} where:

1. S1 is a substring of string a
2. S2 is a substring of string b
3. S1 == S2

Note that two substrings are considered different if they have different starting or ending indices, even if their values are the same. And a substring can be empty.
You are not required to take inputs. You are required to complete the funcion 'findGoodPairs()'.

Example

Input
abc ab

Output
4

Explanation
The good pairs are:
1. ("", "")
2. (a, a)
3. (ab, ab)
4. (b, b)

Constraints

- The lengths of strings a and b will be between 0 and 2000, inclusive.
- Both strings will consist of lowercase English letters only.
