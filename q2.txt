Problem Statement: Find the Beautiful Number

You are given an array of integers A of size n. Your task is to determine the "Beautiful Number" in the array. A "Beautiful Number" is defined as follows:

- It is an element of the array.
- When this number is removed from the array, the product of the remaining numbers is co-prime with this number.

Formally, let B be a beautiful number. Then B satisfies:
- B in A
- gcd(B, product of all numbers of 'A' except B) = 1

If there are multiple beautiful numbers, return the minimum one. If no beautiful number exists, return -1.
You are not required to take inputs. You are required to complete the funcion 'beautifulNumber()'.

Input
- An array 'A'

Output
- Smallest beautiful number if it exists. Otherwise, print -1.

Example
Input
0

Output
-1

Explanation
Since array itself is empty no beautiful number can exist

Input
5
3 6 9 12 15

Output
-1

Explanation
In the example above, the product of all the numbers in the array is 3 * 6 * 9 * 12 * 15 = 29160.

- For 3: The product of all other numbers is 6 * 9 * 12 * 15 = 9720. Since gcd(3, 9720) = 3, 3 is not a beautiful number.
- For 6: The product of all other numbers is 3 * 9 * 12 * 15 = 4860. Since gcd(6, 4860) = 6, 6 is not a beautiful number.
- For 9: The product of all other numbers is 3 * 6 * 12 * 15 = 3240. Since gcd(9, 3240) = 9, 9 is not a beautiful number.
- For 12: The product of all other numbers is 3 * 6 * 9 * 15 = 2430. Since gcd(12, 2430) = 6, 12 is not a beautiful number.
- For 15: The product of all other numbers is 3 * 6 * 9 * 12 = 1944. Since gcd(15, 1944) = 3, 15 is not a beautiful number.

Since none of the numbers result in a gcd of 1 with the product of the other numbers, the output is -1.

Input
4
7 2 5 4

Output
5

Explanation
In the above example, the product of all the numbers in the array is 7 * 2 * 5 * 4 = 280.

- For 3: The product of all other numbers is 2 * 5 * 4 = 40. Since gcd(7, 40) = 1, 7 is a beautiful number.
- For 6: The product of all other numbers is 7 * 5 * 4 = 140. Since gcd(2, 140) = 2, 2 is not a beautiful number.
- For 9: The product of all other numbers is 7 * 2 * 4 = 56. Since gcd(5, 56) = 1, 5 is a beautiful number.
- For 12: The product of all other numbers is 7 * 2 * 5 = 70. Since gcd(4, 70) = 2, 4 is not a beautiful number.

Since two of the numbers result in a gcd of 1 with the product of the other numbers, the output is min(7,5) = 5.

Constraints

- length of A between 0 to 10^4 inclusive
- A[i] can be any positive non-zero integer less than 10^4
